	<h1>Introduction to ChatGPT</h1>    
	<p>Chat GPT stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer.

        <p>It is an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI that has been trained on a huge amount of text data to generate human-like responses to natural language inputs.</p>
        
        <p>Chat GPT has many potential uses, including in chatbots, virtual assistants, and other aplications that require a high level of natural language processing ability.</p>
         
        <p>Anyone can use Chat GPT by integrating it into their own apps or by using one of the many prebuilt chatbot platforms that incorporate the technology. By instance, a company could use Chat GPT to power a virtual customer service agent on their website or an individual could use a chatbot platform to build a personal assistant that can answer questions and perform given tasks.</p>
